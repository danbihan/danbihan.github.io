## What is DevOps?
- <mark>Def</mark>: breaking down the wall between developers and operations to allow more frequent and reliable feature shipping
- Traditional model:
  1. Developers write code
  2. Code is thrown over to Ops
  3. Ops deploy the code and handles its reliability
  - Issues: 
    - Tension between Dev and Ops: Devs care about releasing new features vs. Operations care about maintaining the reliability of software
    - When the code crashes in production, the people handling the crash are not the ones familiar with the code
- DevOps solution is to <mark>get the Devs involved in the Ops process</mark>
  - Automated testing and deployment
  - Easy deployment rollback
  - Enhanced observability of code in production
